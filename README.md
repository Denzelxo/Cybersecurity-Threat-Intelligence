## 🧪 Testing the API

### Using cURL

1. **Get Threat Dashboard**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/threats/dashboard
```

2. **Analyze Specific Threat**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/threats/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"threat_type": "Malware"}'
```

3. **Scan Vulnerabilities**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/vulnerabilities/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target_system": "web-server-1", "scan_type": "full"}'
```

### Using Python Requests

```python
import requests

# Get threat dashboard
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/threats/dashboard')
print(response.json())

# Analyze threat
response = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/threats/analyze',
    json={'threat_type': 'Malware'}
)
print(response.json())
```

## 📊 System Architecture
